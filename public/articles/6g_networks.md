# 6G Networks

6G is the name for the sixth generation of cellular networks, which will deliver truly omnipresent wireless intelligence. Expected to become available early in the 2030s, the 6G research journey is already well underway.

## Objectives
6G is designed to revolutionise how consumers, networks and devices communicate with and among each other. Itâ€™s built to change how networks perform tasks such as joint communication, sensing and positioning. It promises to build critical bridges between physical and virtual spaces to enable new use cases while optimising industry operations.

The opportunities offered by 6G will form the basis of 2030 societies and businesses, with the new and integrated features potentially advancing digitisation.

## Characteristics

* Ultra-High Data Rates
* Ultra-Low Latency
* Massive connectivity
* Energy efficiency
* AI Integration

## Potential Use Cases

* Real-Time holographic video conferencing
* Ultra-High-Definition virtual reality
* Self-driving cars
* Remote surgery
* Industrial IoT

## Differences with 5G
Unlike 5G and previous generations of wireless technologies aimed at driving network performance towards higher bandwidth, lower latency and greater reliability, 6G is designed to meet higher requirements of global coverage, greater spectral efficiency and lower carbon footprints. 6G will significantly differ from 5G by integrating data communications, device positioning and radio-based sensing of the environment into the same radio network.
