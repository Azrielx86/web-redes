# Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN)

Non-terrestrial Networks (NTNs) are wireless communication systems that operate above the Earth's surface, using platforms in the air and in Earth's orbit. These platforms include satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), and geostationary orbit (GEO), as well as high-altitude platforms (HAPS) and drones. They play a crucial role in enhancing global communication coverage, particularly in remote or underserved areas, by filling the connectivity gaps left by traditional ground-based telecommunications infrastructure.

## Characteristics

Non-terrestrial Networks (NTNs) differ from conventional wireless communication networks primarily in their location and coverage.  Another key difference is that NTNs can connect all mobile devices to both terrestrial and satellite networks as part of the 3GPP ecosystem unlike conventional networks where devices connected to the terrestrial network and those connected to satellite are separate.

## Types of NTNs

* Satellite Communication Networks
* High Altitude Platform Systems (HAPS)
* Air-to-Ground Networks

## Use cases

* Precision Agriculture
* Emergency Communications
* Connected Vehicles
* Maritime Communications
* Airborne Communications
* IoT Connectivity
* Broadband Access in Remote Areas
